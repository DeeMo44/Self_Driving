🚗 AI Car Collision Avoidance 🚗
This project showcases an AI car that possesses the ability to dynamically avoid collisions with other cars and borders. It's a fun and interactive simulation that demonstrates the power of artificial intelligence in autonomous driving scenarios.

🎯 Objective
The main objective of this project is to create an AI-controlled car that navigates through a dynamic environment, avoiding obstacles (other cars) and staying clear of the road's borders. The car uses sophisticated collision avoidance algorithms and neural networks to make real-time decisions.

🚀 Features
Advanced Collision Avoidance: The AI car employs cutting-edge collision avoidance techniques to steer away from other cars on the road, ensuring a smooth and safe journey.

Real-time Decision Making: Using neural networks, the AI car can make rapid and accurate decisions, adapting to changing environments and avoiding potential collisions.

Dynamic Environment: The simulation generates a dynamic environment with randomly moving traffic, offering a realistic driving experience for the AI car.

Interactive Visualization: The project comes with an interactive canvas that visually represents the AI car's movements, making it easy to observe its intelligent decision-making process.
